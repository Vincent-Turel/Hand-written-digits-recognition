# Hand-written digits recognition

## Context 

This project dates back to December 2021.

This is a 4-person group project done within the scope of the course CS405 - Date Mining during my exchange semester at Bishop's University, Canada.

## Description 

This project contains 3 different method for recognizing hand-written digits. Heach method is implemented in its own Jupyter notebook :
- The notebook ***svm_group_V.ipynb*** is the code for our SVM method.
- The notebook ***knn_group_V.ipynb*** is the code for our KNN method.
- The notebook ***neuralnetwork_group_V.ipynb*** is the code for our CNN method.

## How to execute

These are 3 Jupyter notebooks so you need to open them with Jupyter and run the code cell by cell.
